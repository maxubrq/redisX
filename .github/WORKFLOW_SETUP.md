# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Summary

## ✅ What Was Configured

### 1. Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`)

A comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:

- **Runs on:**
  - Every push to `main` branch
  - Every pull request to `main` branch

- **Performs:**
  - ✅ Type checking with TypeScript
  - ✅ Test execution with coverage reporting
  - ✅ Project build verification
  - ✅ Badge generation and README updates (main branch only)
  - ✅ Coverage report artifact uploads

### 2. Dynamic Badges

Two badges are automatically updated in `README.md`:

#### Test Status Badge
- ✅ **Passing** (green) - All tests pass
- ❌ **Failing** (red) - Any test fails

#### Coverage Badge
- Color-coded based on coverage percentage:
  - 90%+ → Bright Green
  - 80-89% → Green
  - 70-79% → Yellow
  - 60-69% → Orange
  - <60% → Red

### 3. Coverage Configuration

Updated `vitest.config.ts` to include `json-summary` reporter for badge generation:

```typescript
reporter: ['text', 'json', 'json-summary', 'html']
```

### 4. Local CI Testing

Created `scripts/test-ci-locally.sh` to run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
pnpm test:ci
```

This script:
- Installs dependencies
- Runs type checking
- Executes tests with coverage
- Builds the project
- Shows preview of badges

### 5. Documentation

Created `docs/CI.md` with:
- Detailed workflow explanation
- Coverage thresholds
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement plans

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Development

1. **Before pushing code:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test:ci
   ```

2. **Run individual checks:**
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck  # Type check only
   pnpm coverage   # Tests with coverage
   pnpm build      # Build only
   ```

### On GitHub

1. **Push or create PR** → Workflow runs automatically
2. **Check Actions tab** → View workflow progress
3. **On main branch** → Badges auto-update in README
4. **Download artifacts** → Coverage reports available for 30 days

## 📊 Coverage Thresholds

The project has strict coverage requirements:

| Metric     | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Statements | 95%       |
| Branches   | 90%       |
| Functions  | 95%       |
| Lines      | 95%       |

## 🎯 Badge Examples

Current badges appear at the top of README.md:

```markdown
![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-passing-brightgreen)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-brightgreen)
```

## 🔧 Workflow Features

### Smart Badge Updates
- Only updates on `main` branch pushes
- Uses `[skip ci]` in commit message to prevent loops
- Preserves existing README content

### Caching
- pnpm store is cached for faster builds
- Cache invalidates on `pnpm-lock.yaml` changes

### Error Handling
- Tests run with `continue-on-error` to allow badge generation
- Job fails at the end if tests failed
- Coverage reports uploaded even if tests fail

### Security
- Uses latest GitHub Actions (`@v4`)
- Minimal permissions (`contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`)
- Frozen lockfile ensures reproducible builds

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `.github/workflows/main.yaml` - Main CI workflow
- `docs/CI.md` - CI documentation
- `scripts/test-ci-locally.sh` - Local testing script
- `.github/WORKFLOW_SETUP.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `README.md` - Added badge placeholders
- `vitest.config.ts` - Added `json-summary` reporter
- `package.json` - Added `test:ci` script

### Already Configured:
- `.gitignore` - Already excludes `coverage/` directory

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** to trigger the first workflow run
2. **Check the Actions tab** to see the workflow in progress
3. **Verify badges** are updated in README after merge to main
4. **Run `pnpm test:ci`** locally before each push

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If badges don't update:
1. Check workflow completed successfully
2. Verify you're on `main` branch
3. Check repository permissions
4. Look at workflow logs in Actions tab

For more details, see `docs/CI.md`.
